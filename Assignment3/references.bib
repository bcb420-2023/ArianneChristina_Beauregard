abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.}}

abstract = {Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid and critical precursor to the cellular methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine. Unlike nontransformed cells, cancer cells have a unique metabolic requirement for Met and are unable to proliferate in growth media where Met is replaced with its metabolic precursor, homocysteine. This metabolic vulnerability is common among cancer cells regardless of tissue origin and is known as “methionine dependence”, “methionine stress sensitivity”, or the Hoffman effect. The response of lipids to Met stress, however, is not well-understood. Using mass spectroscopy, label-free vibrational microscopy, and next-generation sequencing, we characterize the response of lipids to Met stress in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 and its Met stress insensitive derivative, MDA-MB-468res-R8. Lipidome analysis identified an immediate, global decrease in lipid abundances with the exception of triglycerides and an increase in lipid droplets in response to Met stress specifically in MDA-MB-468 cells. Furthermore, specific gene expression changes were observed as a secondary response to Met stress in MDA-MB-468, resulting in a downregulation of fatty acid metabolic genes and an upregulation of genes in the unfolded protein response pathway. We conclude that the extensive changes in lipid abundance during Met stress is a direct consequence of the modified metabolic profile previously described in Met stress–sensitive cells. The changes in lipid abundance likely results in changes in membrane composition inducing the unfolded protein response we observe.}

    abstract = {Background Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal.  Principal Findings To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed “Enrichment Map”, a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results.  Conclusions Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).},

  abstract  = "Networks often contain regions of tightly connected nodes, or
               clusters, that highlight their shared relationships. An
               effective way to create a visual summary of a network is to
               identify clusters and annotate them with an enclosing shape and
               a summarizing label. Cytoscape provides the ability to annotate
               a network with shapes and labels, however these annotations must
               be created manually one at a time, which can be a laborious
               process. AutoAnnotate is a Cytoscape 3 App that automates the
               process of identifying clusters and visually annotating them. It
               greatly reduces the time and effort required to fully annotate
               clusters in a network, and provides freedom to experiment with
               different strategies for identifying and labelling clusters.
               Many customization options are available that enable the user to
               refine the generated annotations as required. Annotated clusters
               may be collapsed into single nodes using the Cytoscape groups
               feature, which helps simplify a network by making its overall
               structure more visible. AutoAnnotate is applicable to any type
               of network, including enrichment maps, protein-protein
