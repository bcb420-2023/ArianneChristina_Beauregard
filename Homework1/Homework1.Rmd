## Create Matrix of Random Integers
First, we create a 5 by 10 matrix of random integers. This will sample from integers between 1 and 100, with replacement.

```{r}
mat <- matrix(sample.int(100, size = 50, replace = TRUE), nrow = 5, ncol = 10)
```


## Define Column and Row Names
Next, we define the column names as cond1, cond2, cond3, cond4, cond5, ctrl1, ctrl2, ctrl3, ctrl4, ctrl5. We define the row names as gene1, gene2, gene3, gene4, gene5.
```{r}
colnames(mat) <- c("cond1", "cond2", "cond3", "cond4", "cond5", "ctrl1", "ctrl2", "ctrl3", "ctrl4", "ctrl5")
rownames(mat) <- c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3", "gene4", "gene5")

# View our matrix
mat
```


## Compute Fold Change for each Gene
We compute the log2 fold change for each gene and visualize it in a heatmap.
```{r}
cond <- mat[, 1:5]
ctrl <- mat[, 6:10]
foldchange <- log2(cond/ctrl)
pheatmap::pheatmap(foldchange, main = "Heatmap of log2 fold change")
```
