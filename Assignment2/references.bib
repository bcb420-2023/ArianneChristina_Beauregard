abstract = {Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid and critical precursor to the cellular methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine. Unlike nontransformed cells, cancer cells have a unique metabolic requirement for Met and are unable to proliferate in growth media where Met is replaced with its metabolic precursor, homocysteine. This metabolic vulnerability is common among cancer cells regardless of tissue origin and is known as “methionine dependence”, “methionine stress sensitivity”, or the Hoffman effect. The response of lipids to Met stress, however, is not well-understood. Using mass spectroscopy, label-free vibrational microscopy, and next-generation sequencing, we characterize the response of lipids to Met stress in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 and its Met stress insensitive derivative, MDA-MB-468res-R8. Lipidome analysis identified an immediate, global decrease in lipid abundances with the exception of triglycerides and an increase in lipid droplets in response to Met stress specifically in MDA-MB-468 cells. Furthermore, specific gene expression changes were observed as a secondary response to Met stress in MDA-MB-468, resulting in a downregulation of fatty acid metabolic genes and an upregulation of genes in the unfolded protein response pathway. We conclude that the extensive changes in lipid abundance during Met stress is a direct consequence of the modified metabolic profile previously described in Met stress–sensitive cells. The changes in lipid abundance likely results in changes in membrane composition inducing the unfolded protein response we observe.}

abstract = {Abstract Phylogenetics is a powerful tool for analyzing protein sequences, by inferring their evolutionary relationships to other proteins. However, phylogenetics analyses can be challenging: they are computationally expensive and must be performed carefully in order to avoid systematic errors and artifacts. Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER; http://pantherdb.org) is a publicly available, user-focused knowledgebase that stores the results of an extensive phylogenetic reconstruction pipeline that includes computational and manual processes and quality control steps. First, fully reconciled phylogenetic trees (including ancestral protein sequences) are reconstructed for a set of “reference” protein sequences obtained from fully sequenced genomes of organisms across the tree of life. Second, the resulting phylogenetic trees are manually reviewed and annotated with function evolution events: inferred gains and losses of protein function along branches of the phylogenetic tree. Here, we describe in detail the current contents of PANTHER, how those contents are generated, and how they can be used in a variety of applications. The PANTHER knowledgebase can be downloaded or accessed via an extensive API. In addition, PANTHER provides software tools to facilitate the application of the knowledgebase to common protein sequence analysis tasks: exploring an annotated genome by gene function; performing “enrichment analysis” of lists of genes; annotating a single sequence or large batch of sequences by homology; and assessing the likelihood that a genetic variant at a particular site in a protein will have deleterious effects.},
